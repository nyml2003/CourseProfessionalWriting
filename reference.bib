  abstract = {The exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms are usually regarded as independent. It is suggested that specificity should be interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term meaning. The effects on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance. It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms. Results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure.},

@article{Ahn2022,
  abstract  = {Users on the internet usually have conversations on interesting facts or topics along with diverse knowledge from the web. However, most existing knowledge-grounded conversation models consider only a single document regarding the topic of a conversation. The recently proposed retrieval-augmented models generate a response based on multiple documents; however, they ignore the given topic and use only the local context of the conversation. To this end, we introduce a novel retrieval-augmented response generation model that retrieves an appropriate range of documents relevant to both the topic and local context of a conversation and uses them for generating a knowledge-grounded response. Our model first accepts both topic words extracted from the whole conversation and the tokens before the response to yield multiple representations. It then chooses representations of the first N token and ones of keywords from the conversation and document encoders and compares the two groups of representation from the conversation with those groups of the document, respectively. For training, we introduce a new data-weighting scheme to encourage the model to produce knowledge-grounded responses without ground truth knowledge. Both automatic and human evaluation results with a large-scale dataset show that our models can generate more knowledgeable, diverse, and relevant responses compared to the state-of-the-art models.},
